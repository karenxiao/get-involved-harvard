Harvard Hillel considers every Jewish student as an actor in and author of the on-going story of the Jewish people from ancient days until the present. Our mission, therefore, is to provide every Jewish Harvard student---without regard to ideological commitment or background---appropriate grounding for making meaningful Jewish choices in a complex and changing world. We are guided in this endeavor by four tenets: the centrality of education; pluralism; the development of leaders; and dialogue with Israel.",

GroupTitle: "Harvard Black Men&#39;s Forum",
PurposeStatement: "As Black men in this country, we are constantly faced with the reality of our situation as a people. The issues of fratricide, affirmative action and drug abuse among many others serve to torment our days and haunt our nights. An escape from this reality would be a welcome gift for us all. Although an oasis in the midst of this social and economic desert in which we live is unlikely to appear any time soon, we hold within us the ability to provide a means of temporary relief for ourselves and our comrades, while simultaneously leading our people ever closer to the promised land. This innate ability is no supernatural power given to us by a god, no secret metaphysical strength of mind or body bestowed on those with darker skin. It is instead a power which we observe everyday and is within us all: love.It is the mission of the Harvard Black Men&#39;s Forum to uncover and refine this love in the black men on this campus and channel it to others of our community at large. To this end we will strive to be always willing to lend not just a hand, but our complete bodies and souls to a brother in need. This giving of oneself to a comrade can take many forms; spending a few days out of the week with children you have never met, comforting a brother who has lost a loved one, offering advice to one of our own in the midst of trying times.In short, our aim is to uphold the three principles which are the basis of this organization; brotherhood, manhood and fidelity. Maintaining our allegiance to this mission will no doubt prove to be difficult at times. It will very likely place great strains on the members of this organization in the way that any good moral and spiritual battle does. We do not shrink from this challenge. Instead, we face it with the full knowledge and confidence that we will emerge as victors in the battle for our manhood.",

STAGE does so by bringing college students together with their younger peers to grow through theater and by bringing the broader community together to support it.STAGE recruits members at the start of each semester.  Members are Harvard students with a talent and interest in any or all of the following areas: theatrical performance, dance, oratory, directing, producing, technical design (lights, costumes, set, sound, props), choreography, music directing, script writing/score composing, etc.  Members must also have a distinguished record of public service and must commit to weekly involvement working with the middle school children in STAGE&rsquo;s after-school program.Throughout the school year, STAGE members run a weekly after-school program serving children who would otherwise have little or no exposure to the performing arts.  STAGE uses a curriculum designed to introduce children to the basics of theatrical performance, emphasizing the importance of creativity, communication skills, and self-esteem. STAGE members work with the children to help them develop their own theatrical pieces, both reality-based and imaginative.  In December, STAGE hosts ArtSpectacular - a day-long whirlwind tour in which after-school participants are introduced to all aspects of the performing arts by working with different Harvard student arts organizations.   STAGE&rsquo;s afterschool program culminates in a showcase of the students&rsquo; pieces at the end of the year on campus, intended to highlight the achievements of the students and to raise awareness of the potential for the arts in the community.",

PurposeStatement: "The Kuumba Singers were organized in November 1970 as a channel through which black students could direct their creative energies. The group was established at a time when black students from Harvard, Radcliffe, and other colleges in the Boston area felt themselves becoming increasingly alienated from one another. The choir served not only as a needed source of unity and strength bringing black students together on a regular basis but also as a source of spiritual inspiration. Today that inspiration, unity and strength extend to all those who believe in what the group represents. The Swahili word &#34;kuumba,&#34; loosely translated as &#34;creativity,&#34; embodies the choir&#39;s mission: to express the creativity and spirituality of black people through song. The Kuumba Singers explore and share the rich musical culture of black people through spirituals, gospel, African folk songs, and contemporary music. Black music is a manifestation of the black spirit - it speaks to our every emotion. Moreover, black music helps sustain and direct our culture. It reminds us of our past situation in this country, makes us mindful of the present, and gives us hope and guidance for the future. The choir serves as both a spiritual vessel and as a cultural institution, to educate and inspire the many touched by its musical ministry.",

Ever more so than before, science is being influenced and impacted by legal and societal institutions and century-old laws are being challenged by advancements in technology. Even the fields of science are beginning to merge as the boundaries between physics, chemistry, and biology are rapidly eroding. This trend mandates a new approach towards thinking about the world in which we live. Through a high-quality academic print journal, The Science in Society Review, our organization provides needed and desired opportunities outside the classroom for students to critically examine and express their analysis of complex issues that arise when science intersects with society. In addition, a constantly updated web-journal invites feedback and allows diverse students from around the country to join in a global dialogue that evaluates current scientific issues through legal, economic, cultural, social, and political lenses.",

GroupTitle: "PBHA&#39;s Environmental Action Committee",
PurposeStatement: "The Harvard College Environmental Action Committee seeks to help achieve a sustainable world and protect the environment for its human and non-human inhabitants. To this end, the EAC aims to raise the consciousness of Harvard&#39;&#39;s students to the effect of their own actions on the environment and to their status as stewards of this planet&#39;&#39;s resources. We advocate specific changes at the campus, local, national, and international levels. Furthermore, we serve as a forum for discussion and a source of information on environmental issues. Finally, we seek to enrich our members through fun and fulfilling experiences. The Environmental Action Committee is divided into several subcommittees that function more or less independently, and deal with distinct issues - this is where the real action takes place. Weekly board meetings (location and time TBA) are open to anyone interested in guiding the organization toward the future, and frequent committee-wide events bring everyone together for a common cause or interest. Subcommittees include Earth Day, Environmental Justice, Sustainable Allston, Green Campus, and Enviro-Ed. Contact Mitch Hunter (mghunter@fas@fas), or Amy Heinzerling (apheinz@fas).",

GroupTitle: "PBHA&#39;s Refugee Youth Term Enrichment",
PurposeStatement: "RYTE is a weekly tutoring program that serves high school students from Boston&#39;s diverse and ever-increasing refugee populations, from Kosovo, Somalia, Vietnam, and Ethiopia. The program pairs Harvard undergraduates with high school students in need of help with English skills, SAT preparation, or other academic subjects.  What makes RYTE a unique program is the type of students we cater to: high school students, ages 15-19, who have been in the U.S. anywhere from 1 month to 7 years. Many of these refugees are expected to attend college after high school by parents and family members, or to work, and so RYTE helps them prepare for college through SAT preparatory classes. Without the ability to achieve high grades in the classroom, where they are competing with native Americans, or even to speak the language, it is extremely difficult for these refugees to keep up and have chances at a bright future.Tutors and tutees meet weekly on Friday, Saturday or Sunday.  Friday sessions take place at English High School in Jamaica Plain from 2 p.m. until 4 p.m.  Saturday and Sunday sessions take place here at Harvard from 10 a.m. until 12 p.m.  (Tutors meet their students at the Harvard Square T-stop, and then work together in campus classrooms.)  RYTE also sponsors two weekend fieldtrips to help students adjust to the American lifestyle.  Please contact Kay Lee (lee32@fas) with any questions.  RYTE hopes to continue this tradition of guidance to the high school refugee population.  We need your passion and dedication!",

GroupTitle: "The Harvard College Irish-American Society",
PurposeStatement: "The Irish in America have often been referred to as &ldquo;a lost statistical category&rdquo; frequently characterized by leprechauns, shamrocks, and Guinness.  Beyond the clover, however, lies a fantastic story of struggle, determination, and triumph - true realization of the American Dream.  The tale of the Irish-Americans begins with the rich history of Ireland, and the beauty of Celtic culture.  Centuries of political oppression compounded by acute famine conditions in the mid-1800s served as a springboard of massive immigration to all corners of the globe, and those who arrived on the shores of the United States made an impact unsurpassed by any other immigrant population since.  They arrived on coffin ships by the thousands and inundated America&rsquo;s port cities, bringing with them a strong Catholic faith and rich Celtic tradition; however, they were greeted with scorn and &ldquo;No Irish Need Apply&rdquo; signs throughout the cities.  Yet the initial wave of Irish would come to play a significant role in the Union&rsquo;s Civil War victory, the rise and acceptance of Catholicism, and the emergence of enormous skyscrapers in developing cities.  The subsequent generations began filling the seats of America&rsquo;s most prestigious universities, and winning political offices from coast to coast.  And in 1960, the election of JFK lifted the last &ldquo;No Irish Need Apply&rdquo; sign from its remaining perch - the doors of the White House.  Since then, the contributions of the Irish-Americans have continued, yet the history and culture have waned.  The Harvard College Irish American Cultural Association is an organization of Irish-Americans and appreciators of Irish-American culture. The Society strives to unify Irish-American students at Harvard by holding weekly, monthly, and semester events that engage students in aspects of Irish culture, including dance, music, and literature.  Through the accounts of authors, politicians, and sociologists, we hope to rediscover our Irish character and understand the attributes that make us a distinct subculture in American society.  Together, we seek to promote that positive image of Irish-Americans by educating the Harvard community about the legacy of Irish-Americans and of their contributions to American cities and society.  In addition, we will use our common heritage to network with, and learn from other Irish-Americans in the Boston area.  Above all, we seek to erect a platform for social justice based upon the hardships faced and overcome by our ancestors so as to assist others currently enduring such difficulties.  Our mission is to prove that the Irish are by no means &ldquo;lost&rdquo; in today&rsquo;s America.",

PurposeStatement: "The Mission Hill Summer Program (MHSP) is a seven-week, affordable, academic camp which serves families from Roxbury&#39;s Mission Main and Alice Taylor Housing Developments, both predominantly African American and Latino communities. Founded at the request of community members, the camp seeks to provide a safe space for the 80 campers, ages 6 to 13, for the price of $95 for the entire summer. Each morning is strictly academic, as campers learn literacy and math in order to prevent summer learning loss and prepare them for the next year in the classroom. In the afternoons, the campers go on field trips and perform their own service projects across the greater Boston area in order to provide them with deeper experiences within their greater community than they generally get in school. MHSP provides crucial services for families who struggle to find affordable, innovative childcare. Many have siblings in the program and return year after year, and MHSP has become a fixture in the community. MHSP also hires 12 teens from the community to work as Junior Counselors. Senior Counselors will live in Roxbury and will work closely with the families of their campers.  MHSP is looking for committed counselors with an interest in poverty, social justice, social work, and education.",

NAYEP serves children of all tribal ancestries from all across the Boston area.  Senior counselors each lead a group of 8-10 children between 9 am and 4 pm on weekdays.  Our mornings are focused on curriculum, our afternoons are usually reserved for field trips and constructive recreation (such as swimming lessons). Curriculum is developed by each senior counselor and therefore changes each summer, but all major academic areas are covered.  We also spend a great deal of focus on Native culture, history, myth and identity, as well as health and environmental issues, multiculturalism, and developing creativity.  Each senior counselor has a classroom in the basement of NAICOB, the North American Indian Center of Boston.  We have a particular challenge in that our campers come from all kinds of social and economic backgrounds.  In-depth knowledge/experience in Native Issues is not necessarily a prerequisite for the job of senior counselor.

The afternoons are spent participating in field trips and activities that supplement the learning received in the classroom, as well as provide a source of recreation for the children. The goal is to not only promote academic achievement, but also to cultivate excitement about learning, to expose Roxbury children to a world not yet discovered by them, to foster an understanding of how integral they are to the world, and to give the children concrete tolls that they may use later in life to participate and better this world in its greater sense.  Roxbury Youth initiative initially began as two separate camps serving the communities of Academy Homes and Dudley, which are both in Roxbury. Last year these two were combined allowing the program to serve Roxbury as one entity. Roxbury is a predominantly African-American and Latino community located in Boston.",

Unique characteristics distinguished Irish step dancing from other forms of dance, and dancers became known for their rigid upper bodies, precise movements, and percussive beats.  Today, Irish Dancing has become a popular modern form of dance throughout all of Europe, Australia, and the Americas.  Dancers learn a variety of steps choreographed to traditional Irish music; the dances may be performed in light shoes or heavy shoes, as solo dances or as team dances.  The Harvard College Irish Dancers, named &#xFFFD;Corcairdhearg&#xFFFD; after the Irish word for &#xFFFD;Crimson,&#xFFFD; are a group of students dedicated to choreographing, practicing, and performing Irish Dancing at Harvard.  The group serves three functions to incorporate all levels of dancing.  Firstly, the dancers showcase their work by participating in various cultural shows on campus and by holding performances of their own.  Weekly practices allow the students to create and perfect new steps and to share different styles of the dance with one another.  Secondly, the group holds classes for inexperienced dancers to learn the basics of Irish Dancing.

PurposeStatement: "The Harvard College Global Hunger Initiative works to address the underlying causes of the global food crisis by brainstorming and developing new models that can alleviate the recent food shortage, advance education, improve technologies, increase economic opportunity, and tackle the root challenges in poverty alleviation. We advocate for policies that increase emergency aid to those affected by the hunger crisis, as well as long-term developmental programs in affected countries. We aim to have an agenda of both action and advocacy, bridging students from the undergraduate, graduate, and professional schools, as well as community members in Cambridge and Allston to alleviate global hunger.  We are committed to helping families in poor communities improve their lives and achieve lasting victories over poverty.  We pursue our mission with both compassion and commitment.  With action as our priority, the Harvard College Global Hunger Initiative will focus on brainstorming and crafting actionable responses to challenges in agriculture, by focusing mainly on: (i) technology and innovation, (ii) public and economic policy, (iii) environment and its disproportionate effects on agricultural communities, (iv) education and the empowerment of women, and (v) access to clean and safe drinking water, which is often coupled with the scarcity of food. The Harvard College Global Hunger Initiative will do more than raise consciousness &ndash; it will provide substantive ways to engage students in brainstorming, developing, and testing models. Current solutions to alleviating the global food crisis has shown to be frail in recent years.  We need creativity, novel thinking, and the bridging of disciplines to create sustainable models to tackle developmental challenges.",

In the process of researching, writing, and organizing, we educate ourselves about the political process, engage policymakers, inform public discourse, support activists, and prepare ourselves for a future of leadership and action. Our policy work, training, networking, publications, conferences, and programs provide the civic education rarely found in our curricula and classrooms, preparing our members for a life of democratic engagement. Roosevelt ideas fill a particularly critical policy gap at the local and state levels, providing a powerful example of the active citizen&rsquo;s impact. By connecting the most dedicated students and their work to progressive organizations, we also create a conduit for future leaders and foster the progressive movement as a whole. Roosevelt emphasizes learning by doing because students learn best through action and can contribute meaningfully to society while still part of an academic environment. By focusing on ideas rather than politics, we engage a wide range of students, fostering a sense of civic duty in the engineer, nurse, and architect as well as in the policy major and grassroots organizer. As these student members enter professional careers, they carry forward a progressive vision, valuable relationships, and the skills to realize a better society.",

Billed as a Jewish Social Action group, Shani constantly has these two goals at the forefront of its agenda even as it functions as a fun activity and social space for students interested in singing Jewish music.  The musical repertoire itself is broad: Renaissance-period liturgical choral music, modern Israeli pop, and Hebrew parodies of Billy Joel songs or the Harvard Fight Song are realized potentials for the type of music Shani performs. Shani aims to bring this music to between five and seven concerts a semester, most of which are performed at nearby nursing homes (such as the Hebrew Rehabilitation Center in Roslindale or the Chestnut Park facility in Brighton) or at charity events.  In addition, Shani makes appearances on campus at events related to Jewish holidays and interfaith relations, as well as in a campus concert of its own at least once a year.  Judaism for Shani is embodied in both of these main goals: Jewish culture in its music and a sense of a Jewish mission of morality, social action, and &#34;Tikkun Olam&#34; in its performance venues and agenda.",

PurposeStatement: "PBHA&rsquo;s South Boston After School (SAS) is an arts-based literacy program for low-income youth who reside in South Boston. SAS utilizes an enrichment curriculum to promote the positive youth development of first and second graders who attend the James F. Condon Elementary School. SAS strives to empower youth through an academic enrichment and arts-based literacy curriculum, emphasizing academic confidence, conflict resolution, interdependence, prevention of risk-taking behaviors, and respect for diversity. Each Monday and/or Wednesday (2:00 &ndash; 5:30 PM), tutors will support one or two students with their homework and then participate in group-wide workshop activities. SAS participants and volunteers also attend events like field trips and Family Fun Nights so that students, families, and volunteers can build meaningful relationships. SAS also builds upon connections made over the summer by providing programming for the same students served by the South Boston Outreach Summer program.",
